# Symmetry detection

This program is an implementation of some algorithms used for symmetry detection in 3D sufraces described in
[this paper](http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Podolak_2006_APS/symmpaper.pdf).

## Requirements

* the [OpenMesh](http://www.openmesh.org/) library (v4.1)
* the [Google Test framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) (for testing , v1.7)
